ATAG 
===========
ATAG provides guidelines aimed at making authoring tools, such as Joomla, more accessible. It focuses on ensuring that tools used to create web content are usable by people with disabilities, both for content creation and for maintaining accessibility standards in the final product.

When we say that Joomla is an accessible authoring tool, it means that Joomla provides the necessary features and infrastructure to help developers create websites and applications that are accessible to people with disabilities. As an authoring tool, Joomla enables content creators, developers, and site administrators to produce websites that meet accessibility standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).
For extension developers, this means that the extensions they build for Joomla should be designed with accessibility in mind. Here are a few key points to consider:

<strong>Code Structure:</strong>>
Extensions should follow proper HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practices to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and alternative input devices.

** Semantic HTML: **
Using proper HTML elements (such as headings, lists, forms, buttons) is essential for ensuring that content is structured in a way that makes sense to users relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies.

** Keyboard Accessibility: ** 
Extensions should ensure that all interactive elements (such as forms, buttons, and links) can be accessed and used via the keyboard. This is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse.
